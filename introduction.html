	    <li>obstacles</li>
	    <ol>
	        <li>familiarity &mdash; a fresh adventurous look at the parabolic words and acts of Jesus in a larger light of their entire gospel and biblical context</li>
	        <li>can anything "fresh or adventurous" be said about Scripture?</li>
	        <ol>
	            <li>we believe the holy scriptures to be the Word of God and to contain all things necessary to salvation&hellip;</li>
	            <li>often, when people say what the Bible is about, they let their own mindset ride roughshod over what actually lies on the pages</li>
	            <li>openness is the major requirement for approaching the Scriptures</li>
	        </ol>
	    </ol>
	    <li>Jesus, on why he used parables</li>
	    <ol>
	        <li>"seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand" [Mark 4:12]</li>
	        <li>the mystery of the Kingdom is a <em>radical</em> mystery &mdash; even when you tell people about it in so many words, it remains permanently intractable to make sense of it</li>
	    </ol>
	    <li>parables call attention to unsatisfactoriness of previous explanations and understandings</li>
	    <ol>
	        <li>for example, [Luke 18], the parable of <em>the pharisee and the publican</em> &mdash; "insulting", God, Jesus informs, is not the least bit interested in wonderful lists of religious and moral accomplishments &mdash; instead, Jesus informs:</li>
	            <ol>
	                <li>Kingdom of God will be given to babies sooner than to respectable religionists</li>
	                <li>a camel will go through needle's eye sooner than a solid citizen will get into the kingdom</li>
	                <li>"Son of Man" is about to fulfill "messiahship" by dying as a common criminal (addressed to disciples only)</li>
	            </ol>
	    </ol>
	    <li>G.K Chesterton: if you give people an analogy they do not understand, graciously offer another. If they say they don't understand that one either, offer them a third. But from there on, if they insist they still do not understand, the only thing left is to praise them for the one truth they do have a grip on: "Yes, that is quite correct, you do not understand."</li>
	    <li>After 2,000 years exposure to Scripture, are we less likely to need parabolic tutelage?</li>
	    <ol>
	        <li>We still misunderstand</li>
	        <ol>
	            <li><em>the prodigal son</em> is not about a boy's vices; it is about a father's forgiveness</li>
	            <li><em>the laborers in the vineyard</em> are not the central characters in the story; they are merely stick-figures Jesus uses to rub his hearers' noses in the outrageous grace of a vineyard owner who gives equal pay for unequal work</li>
	            <li>the Christ figure in <em>the good samaritan</em> is not the Samaritan, but the battered, half-dead man on the ground</li>
	        </ol>
	    </ol>
	    <li>the greek word for parable is <em>parabole</em></li>
	    <ol>
	        <li>only occurs in books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke</li>
	        <li>John, infrequently, uses another word, <em>paroimia</em> ("adage" or "dark saying") &mdash; no parables in the usual sense appear in the 4th gospel</li>
	        <li>etymologically, a <em>parabole</em> is simply a comparison</li>
	        <li>some "parables" are little more than one-liners</li>
	    </ol>
	    <li>if we want to hear the actual ticking of Jesus' mind, we can hardly do better than to study his parabolic words and acts over and over &mdash; with our minds open not only to learning but to joy</li>
