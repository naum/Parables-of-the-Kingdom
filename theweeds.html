<h2>the weeds</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Matthew 13:24-43</li>
  <li>the parable flouts truths of agronomy</li>
  <ol>
      <li>chokes out good plants that Jesus deplored in the Sower</li>
      <li>guarantees a bumper crop of unwanted weed seeds to plague the next season's planting</li>
  </ol>
  <li><em>doing nothing</em> is the preferred response to evil</li>
  <ol>
      <li>the "evil" is to be suffered, not resisted</li>
      <li>since good and evil in this world commonly inhabit not only the same field but even the same individual human beings &mdash; since that is, there are no unqualified good guys any more than there are any unqualified bad guys &mdash; the only result of a truly dedicated campaign to get rid of evil will be the abolition of everybody</li>
      <li>the enemy depends on the forces of goodness, <em>insofar as he can sucker them into taking up arms against the confusion he has introduced</em>, to do his work &mdash; that is precisely why the enemy <em>goes away</em> after sowing the weeds: he has no need whatsoever to hang around</li>
      <li>does this form the basis of a case for pacifism?</li>
      <ol>
          <li>parable does not say resistance to evil is morally wrong, only that it is salvifically ineffective</li>
          <li>those who take the sword, perish by the sword &mdash; descriptively, not prescriptively</em>
      </ol>
      <li><em>Aphete</em> [let, permit, suffer], <em>Aphienai</em> second meaning, when applied to debts, trespasses, sins, and so on, comes out in English as "forgive"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Jesus does indeed end on the note of the ultimate triumph of justice</li>
  <ol>
      <li>God is in charge, and he will, under eschatological circumstances, get his own way</li>
      <li>but in the present circumstances of the world, the <em>mystery of the kingdom</em> is likewise quite in charge and thoroughly capable of getting its own way</li>
  </ol>
  <li>box scores</li>
  <ol>
      <li><em>catholicity</em> - catholicity of evil</li>
      <li><em>mystery</em> - Jesus attempt to assign a reason for the presence of evil</li>
      <li><em>actual, present working of the kingdom</em> - the wheat successfully does its proper work</li>
      <li><em>hostility and response</em> - inveterate Pelagianism, our tendency to think our own moral efforts are necessary to the plan of salvation &mdash; leads us to imagine that the best way for us to give the kingdom a helping hand is to take up arms as promptly as possible against the enemies of the Lord</li>
      <ol>
          <li>only God, it says, only the Farmer in charge of the universal operation, knows how to deal successfully with evil &mdash; he wills to deal with it only by <em>aphesis</em>: by forgiveness, by permission, by letting it be &mdash; he still deals with it in terms of something that is a mystery to us now, namely the Resurrection</li>
          <li>no matter what you do, the yeast works anyway &mdash; your responses advance your satisfaction, not its success</li>
      </ol>
  </ol>
  <li><em>He who has ears, let him hear</em></li>  
</ol>
