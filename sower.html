<h2>the sower, &ldquo;the watershed of the parables&rdquo;</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, Luke 8:4-15</li>
  <li>three-step presentation</li>
  <ol>
    <li>the parable itself</li>
    <li>disciples ask Jesus a question</li>
    <li>Jesus allegorical interpretation</li>
  </ol>
  <li>whom do we usually identify as the sower?</li>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Word of God</em>, Johannine teaching &mdash; God himself</li>
    <li><em>the Word</em> has to mean the eternal Son</li>
    <li>Jesus has already, and literally, been sown everywhere in the world &mdash; and quite without a single bit of earthly cooperation or even consent</li>
    <li>Jesus interpretation makes the parable profoundly complex</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Jesus explanation</li>
  <ol>
    <li><em>catholicity</em> &mdash; it is at work everywhere, always, and for all</li>
    <ol>
      <li>&ldquo;the field is the world&rdquo;</li>
      <li>gentiles might be brought in; worse yet, no guarantee that the chosen people might not be left out</li>
    </ol>
    <li><em>mystery &mdash; left-handed rather than right-handed uses of power</em></li>
    <ol>
      <li><em>seed</em> and <em>sowing</em> (Matt 13:24-27, Matt 13:31, Matt 17:20, John 12:24)</li>
      <li>imagery of seed &mdash; disproportionately small</li>
      <li>seeds disappear</li>
      <li>Jesus entire work proceeds as does the work of a seed; it takes place in a mystery, in secret &mdash; in a way that, as Luther said, can neither be known nor felt, but only <em>believed</em>, <em>trusted</em></li>
    </ol>
    <li><em>present actuality &mdash; seeds do work</em></li>
    <ol>
      <li>seed that falls on the road and is eaten by birds</li>
      <ol>
        <li>just as the birds recognize seed for what it is even if the pavement doesn't, so the devil recognizes the power of the Word even when human beings don't</li>
        <li>the Word, like the seed, still works on its own terms</li>
      </ol>
      <li>seed that falls into the other three situations &mdash; the seed actually does its proper, reproductive work</li>
    </ol>
    <li><em>hostility and response</em></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Christians have denied the reality of praeter-human evil, or they have given the Old Deceiver far more time and attention than deserved</li>
      <ol>
        <li>hosts of evil, in the mystery of his death and resurrection, beaten by Jesus</li>
        <li>the devil has no power against the Word</li>
      </ol>
      <li>seed eaten by birds is as much seed as the seed that produced a hundredfold &mdash; the snatching of the Word by the devil &mdash; and the rejection of it by the shallow and the choking of it by the worldly &mdash; all take place <em>within</em> the working of the kingdom, not prior to it or outside of it</li>
      <li>in our day and age, we have come to understand that seeds don't do all the work &mdash; but in Jesus' day and for a very long time after it, that was not the common suppostion</li>
      <li>karpos (fruit)</li>
      <ol>
        <li>&ldquo;true vine&rdquo; (John 15), &ldquo;works of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit&rdquo; (Galations 5:16-26)</li>
        <li>call for a response from us; but that response is to be one that is appropriate not to the accomplishing of a <em>work</em> but the bearing of <em>fruit</em></li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
