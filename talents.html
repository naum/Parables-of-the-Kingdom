<h2>The Talents</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A14-30&amp;version=NLT">Matthew 25:14-30</a></p>

<p>It is about the &#8220;one thing necessary&#8221; (Luke 10:42): the response of trust, of faith in Jesus free acceptance of us by the grace of his death and resurrection. It is in other words, about a faithful, Mary-like waiting upon Jesus himself as the embodiment of the mystery &#8212; and about the danger of substituting some prudent, fretful Martha-like business of our own for that waiting. It is not at all about the rewarding of good works or the punishment of evil ones.</p>

<p>(1) A judgment rendered on faith-in-action, not on the results of faith. God is not a bookkeeper looking for results &#8212; the only bookkeeper is the servant who decided he had to fear a non-existent audit and hid his one talent in the ground.</p>

<p>(2) A jubilation of the Lord&#8217;s joy at throwing money around &#8212; a divine party. But there will always be dummies who refuse to trust a good thing when it is handed to them on a platter.</p>

<p>(3) The sheer needlessness of fear, the unnecessariness of our ever having to dread God. Jesus parades through his parables pitiful turkeys to shock us into recognizing the stupidity of unfaith. <em>We spend our lives invoking upon ourselves imagined necessities, creating God in the image of our own fears &#8212; and all the while, he is beating us over the head with the balloon of grace and the styrofoam baseball bat of a vindicating judgment.</em> There are no lengths to which God won&#8217;t go to prove there are no restrictions on the joy he wants to share with us.</p>
