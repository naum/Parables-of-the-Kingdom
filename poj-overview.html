<h2>Revew / Parables of Judgment Overview</h2>

<p>The church, by and large, has always been more receptive to judgment-as-settling-scores than to judgment as proceeding out of, and in accordance with, the reconciling grace of resurrection.</p>

<h3>Colors of the Parables:</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Parables of the Kingdom</dt>
    <dd><strong>Green</strong>, about growing, seeds and plans. About the mystery of a kingdom already planted, a kingdom at hand, a kingdom in our midst</dd>
    <dt>Parables of Grace</dt>
    <dd><strong>Purple</strong>, about passionate selfless love. Love that works by death.</dd>
    <dt>Parables of Judgment</dt>
    <dd><strong>White</strong>, light of the world. Contain all the colors of the other parables.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Jesus must not be read as having baited us with grace only to clobber us in the end with law.</p>

<h3>Master keys to the parables</h3>

<p>The difference between heaven and hell is simply that those in heaven accept the endless forgiveness, while those in hell reject it.</p>
